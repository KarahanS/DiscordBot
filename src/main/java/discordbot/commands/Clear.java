				 * We need to create a List of messages in order to give them as a parameter to .deleteMessages(). 
				 * .getHistory() returns a MessageHistory object. This object has a method named .retrievePast(int amount).
				 * .retrievePast() method retrieves the amount of messages that is given to it. In order to get a List<Message> 
				 * type at the end, we need to call .complete() method. Truth be told, I don't know why, I'll find out. 
				 * Notice that .retrievePast(int amount) doesn't return List<Message>, returns RestAction<List<Message>>.
				 * 
				 * This is the information about RestAction in JDA github page. 
				 * 
				 * If you understand RestAction you understand JDA.
				 * In JDA 3.0 we introduced the new RestAction class which basically is a terminal between the JDA user and the Discord REST API.
				 * The RestAction is a step between specifying what the user wants to do and executing it, it allows the user to specify how JDA should deal with their Request.
				 * However this only works if you actually tell the RestAction to do something. That is why we recommend checking out whether or not 
				 * something in JDA returns a RestAction. If that is the case you have to execute it using one of the RestAction execution operations:
				 * 
				 * queue(), queue(Consumer), queue(Consumer, Consumer)
				 * These operations are asynchronous and will not execute within the same Thread.
				 * This means that you cannot use procedural logic when you use queue(), unless you use the callback Consumers.
				 * Only similar requests are internally executed in sequence such as sending messages in the same channel or adding reactions 
				 * to the same message.
				 * submit() = Provides request future to cancel tasks later and avoid callback hell.
				 * complete() = This operation will block the current Thread until the request has been finished and will return the response type.
				 * Note: We recommend using queue() or submit() when possible as blocking the current Thread can cause downtime and will use more resources.
