		 * Embed is a little information box. We can create an embed using EmbedBuilder.
		 * .setTitle() simply takes the title to be shown at the uppermost part of the embed.
		 * .addField() adds a subtitle and a description below it respectively. For now I don't know
		 * why we add a boolean value. When I find out, I'll write.
		 * .setColor() sets the color of embed. You can find color codes from google. You need to
		 * copy paste the code without "#" and put "0x" at the very beginning.
		 * Then you need to send this embed as a message. sendMessage takes a String, .build() returns
		 * the embed in a string form.
		 * .clear() erases the embed object. We need to do it since it takes lots of space if we leave them behind.
		 * Actually you should be still calling that object after using clear() method, however any subtraction or 
		 * adding won't effect your embed anymore.
		 * .setFooter() also creates a footer design with a text and an extremely tiny image. It takes an URL as a parameter,
		 * I wrote a code so that it will take the image URL of the member who asks for it's embed.
